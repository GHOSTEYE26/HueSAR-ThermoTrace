## 🚀 Launch HueSAR into Your Universe!

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** 🐍  
- **pip** for dependency magic  
- A love for imaging innovation! ✨

### Step 1: Clone the HueSAR Galaxy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HueSAR.git
cd HueSAR
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Cosmos
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Summon the Dependencies
Install the stellar libraries HueSAR needs to shine using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: On Windows, you might need to install `tkinter` separately. On Ubuntu, use: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.
